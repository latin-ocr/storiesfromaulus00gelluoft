6 INTRODUCTION

born in Africa, but this view can hardly be said to have
been fully demonstrated. From the fact that he assumed
the coya virilis at Rome (a ceremony which took place usually
before the close of the sixteenth year of a boy's life), it
is clear that, if born elsewhere, he was brought to Rome at
an early age.

The date of his birth can be determined only approxi-
mately. We know that he spent some time at Athens. In
all his references to this period, he characterizes himself
and his associates as iuvenes. Now if we could define this
term precisely, and if we could tell exactly when he was

in Athens, the determination of the year of his birth would ’

be a mere matter of arithmetic. But, unfortunately, neither
of these things can'be done with absolute certainty. While
the term iuvenis might be applied with propriety to any one
between the ages of seventeen and forty-five, there is never-
theless some proof that it was generally applied, when used
at all strictly, to the latter part of this period. For example,
,a remark of Varro <see page 26, note 2) is cited to the effect
that, with the thirtieth year, adulescentia¹ ends, and iuventus
begins. That Gellius himself understood the term in this
stricter sense, may be infer-red from the following considera-
tions: While at Athens he devoted himself to philosophy,
which in those days was the third and last step in a liberal
education, the two preceding stages consisting of grammar
(which included literature) and rhetoric. In all the passages
in which Gellius speaks of his grammatieal studies at Rome,
he describes himself as adulescens or adulescentulus. By
thus consistently calling himself adulescens while studying
grammar at Rome, but iuvenis while reading in philosophy
at Athens, he makes it evident, Ι think, that some consider-
able interval elapsed betweenthe two periods of his life. If

1 Adulescentia began with the assumption of the toya virilis.
