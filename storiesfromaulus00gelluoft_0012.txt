8 INTRODUCTION

was on intimate terms, also, with Antonius Iulianus, a Span-
iard of distinction, resident in Rome as a professional teacher
of rhetoric. Whether he ever was, technically speaking, a
pupil of Antonius, cannot be certainly determined. In several
passages, Gellius speaks of visiting the famous rhetorician,
M. Cornelius Fronto, who occupied the leading position in the
literary circles of Rome during the reign of Antoninus Pius.
Indeed, his contemporaries regarded him as a rival of Cicero.

From the accession of Hadrian (117 A.D.), the literary
history of the second century is the history of the develop-
ment of antiquarianism. The creative faculty was extinct3
and “the literary class at Rome had reached the point at
which it is easier to make books about books than to make
books about life, and of course, for such a purpose, the oldest
books are the best.’' This ‘tendency, which, though it cul-
minated in this century, began long before that time,——in
fact, as early as the days of Cicero and Horace,—was
advanced by the influence of Hadrian and by the teachings
and example of Apollinaris and Fronto. We are told, by an
ancient author, that Hadrian preferred Cato to Cicero, Ennius
to Vergil, and Caelius Antipater to Sallust. Apollinaris de-
voted especial attention to Terence, and perhaps, also, to
Plautus. Fronto's favorite authors, to the study of whom
he was always urging his pupils, were Cato, Plautus, Ennius,
Lucretius, and Sallust. Of these, the first four belong to the
archaic period of Latin literature, while Sallust's style is
marked by frequent imitation of the older writers.

In view of these facts, it is not strange that Gellius
exhibits an especial fondness for all that is archaic in litera-
ture. No doubt he received his first impulse in this direc-
tion from Apollinaris. This impulse was strengthened, we
may be sure, by his intercourse with Fronto3 for he tells us
(xix. 8. 1) that, as often as he heard Fronto converse, he
came away cultior doctiorque. (See also ἓ 12.)
