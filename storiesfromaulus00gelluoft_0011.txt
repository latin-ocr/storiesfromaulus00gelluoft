AULUS GELLIUS: HIS LIFE AND STUDIES 7

we assume that, at the time of his residence at Athens, he
was about thirty years of age, we shall not greatly err.

It remains to determine, if possible, the date of his sojourn
in Greeee. In this connection we have but a single hint upon
which any reliance can be placed. Gellius informs us that,
while at Athens, he saw a good deal of the philosopher Pere-
grinus Proteus. Since Peregrinus died in 166 A.D., it is evi-
· dent that Gellius' residenee in Attica precedes that date.
If our assumption is correct, -that at this time he was about
thirty years old,—it follows that he was born not later than
136 Aa). It is, of course, possible that his birth preceded
that date by some years, but upon this point we have no
definite data.

3. Family3 Early ‘naming—Though neither the time
nor the place of his birth can be determined with certainty,
it may reasonably be inserted that he came of a good ·
family—a family, too, possessed of considerable wealth.
This is shown by the fact that he was able to study under
the best teachers of the day, by his stay in Athens, and
his journeys to other parts of Greece3 and by the further
fact that he held judicial office at Rome — a distinction
not often attainable by those who had no claim to be con-
sidered wealthy. He studied grammar under Sulpicius
Apollinaris, a' Carthaginian scholar of great learning and
distinction, whom he esteemed so highly that, even in the
years of his later life, he appealed to his authority. It was
doubtless from Apollinaris that he received the abiding
stimulus which led him to devote so large a portion of his
life, even in the midst of engrossing occupations, to gram·
matical and literary studies.

4. Studies in Rhetoric. —From grammar, Gellius turned
his attention to rhetoric, especially under Titus Castricius,
the foremost rhetorician of the time, who had, in an especial
degree, enjoyed the esteem of the emperor Hadrian. Gellius
