Bc), Gavius Bassus, C. Iulius Hyginus (64 1³.c.-17 An),
Verrius Flaccus, Pliny the Elder (23-7 9 A.D.), and Sulpicius
Apollinaris (ξ 3). Ι11 purely literary matters' the sources
most frequently employed are T. Maccius Plautus (254-184
B.c.), Q. Ennius (239-169 B.c.), M. Porcius Cato (234-149
13.c.), Claudius Quadrigarius (about 100 B.c.), and Vergil (70-
19 B.c.). Of the Greek writers whom Gellius quotes most

’ hequently, we may mention Aeschines, Aeschylus, Aristotle,

Aristophanes, Euripides, Herodotus, Homer, Plato, Plutarch,
and Sophocles. It is worthy of remark that for the most
part the Latin writers mentioned above belong to a period
long prior to Gellius' own- time. His more immediate

literary predecessors he seems to have neglected, for he v

never mentions Tibullus, Propertius, Ovid, Livy, IuvenaL
Quintilian, Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, Martial, or Statius,
and there is but a single reference to Horace in all the
twenty books.

ΠΙ. VAJmE OF 'nm NocrEs Ar'rrcAE

12. The Noctes Atticae is a Representative Work, since it
not only refiects perfectly the nature of the subjects (ξ 10)
which engaged the attention of the liter-ary men of the second
century A.D., but also forcibly depicts the spirit in which their
labors were prosecuted. Attention has been called above
(ξ 4) to their fondness for the writers of the archaic period
of Latin literature. In this regard our author shows him-
self a thorough-going child of his time. In all matters relat--
ing to grammar, lexicography, or literary criticism, Gellius
constantly appeals to the antiquiores, maiores, and veteres, by
which terms he means the writers chiefly of the ante—classica]

1 Under this head Ι include the chapters dealing with history and
biography, together with the numerous anecdotes seattered throughout
the work and the many passages cited from Greek and Latin authors, as
illustrative of some point ot grammar or criticism.
