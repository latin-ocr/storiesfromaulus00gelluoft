period. Of these writers, those who stand highest in his
estimation are Plautus and Ennius among poets, Cato Censor ⁴
among orators. In the Noctes Atticae vi. 17. 4 Plautus is
characterized as homo linquae atque eleqantiae in verbis
Latinae princeps ‚· in xix, 8. 6 he is called the linquae
Latinae decus. Gellius cites him in at least thirty-five
places, and the quotations cover nearly the whole range of
the extant plays. Ennius is cited as an authority in more
than forty passages, and is repeatedly mentioned in terms
of the highest approbation. To Cato's authority Gellius
makes appeal in over sixty places, a single passage often
containing two or more quotations from his works. In x. 3.
ἓξ 15, 16 Gellius says that any one who reads Cato aright
cannot fail to perceive that Cato contentus eloquentia aetatis
suae non fuit et id iam tum facere voluit, quod Cicero postea
perfecit.

13. Quotations from Early Latin Authors. —Of especial
interest and value are the numerous quotations from early
writers whose works are no longer extant. For such por-
tions as yet remain of the oldest Latin literature, ey. the
works of Livius Andronicus, Quintus Ennius, Cn. Naevius,
and the early historians, we are almost wholly indebted to
quotations by various grammarians. In this connection the
obligations of Latin scholarship to Gellius are far from
small. In giving these quotations from the older writers,
he often adds information concerning their careers, or their
works, and in this way his contributions to our knowledge
of the history of Latin literature are of very great impor-
tance. For example, practically all that is known of the
life of Plautus, the greatest comic poet of Rome, is derived
from the third chapter of the' third book of the Noctes
Atticae. Again, Gellius is an important, in some instances
the sole, source of information concerning those of his con-
temporaries who devoted themselves to literary pursuits.
