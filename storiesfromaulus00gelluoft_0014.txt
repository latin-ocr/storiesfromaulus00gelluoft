students (xv. 2. 3), and of the celebration of the Saturnalia,
the great festival of Saturn, which fell in December (xviii. 23
xviii. 13). He visited Delphi (xii. 5. 1), Eleusis (viii. 10),

and Patrae, a town in the Peloponnesus, which at this time ’

seems to have possessed a library of some importance (xviii.
9. 5). It was during his stay in Attica, also, that he began
to collect, or at any rate to arrange, the excerpts which he
subsequently incorporated into his published work (ἓ 8).

7. Later Life. —Of his career at Rome, after his return

self on the simplicity of this title3 for says he, “I have in

Greek and Roman, have given to works of this class.'' As

Silvae, Minerva's Robe, The Horn of Amalthea or Cornu
Copiae, Honey-Combs, Meadows, Flowerets, Lights, and
Crazy Quilts. He tells us, also (page 15, line 1), that one
object, at least, which he kept before him in the compilation
of the work, was to afford recreation to his children. So
Cicero wrote his De Officiis for the benefit of his son Marcus,
and Macrobius compiled his Saturnalia (written about 400
