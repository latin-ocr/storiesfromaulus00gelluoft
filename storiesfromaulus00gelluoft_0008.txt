4 PREFACE

The text, in point of language and spelling, is in the
main that of Hertz, as given in his critical edition. The
chief changes will be found on page 39, lines 6 to 10, page
68, line 17, and page 79, lines 7 and 8. The motive of these
changes has been to supply a text easily readable and to
obviate the necessity of a long and. intricate note. Through-
out the book all vowels knovcrn to be long have been carefully
marked. In syllables containing vowels long by position Ι
have followed the views of Anton Marx, as explained in his
Hillfsbuchlein fiir die Aussprache der lateinischen Vokale
in positionslanqen Silben (second edition, Berlin, 1889).

Ι am under especial obligations to my former pupil, Miss
Alice E. Chapman,‘ who has read the book in manuscript
and while passing through the press, and has made many

useful suggestions. CHARLES KNAPP,

BARNARD Gonnum, June 1, 1895.
