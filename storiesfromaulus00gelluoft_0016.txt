12 INTRODUCTION

the contents that no complete classification of them is possi-
ble. Still the greater part of the work may be roughly
distributed into certain great divisions. Matters of lexicog-
raphy claim over one hundred ohapters, while questions of
etymology and grammar absorb ten and thirty respectively.
Fully sixty chapters are devoted to philosophy in its several
departments of metaphysics‚ ethics (theoretical and applied),
and logio. , Literary criticism absorbs twenty-eight chapters,
textual criticism twelve, antiquities (social, politieal, relig-
ious) twenty-seven, history and biography thirty-six, rhetoric
nine. Thus by far the larger portion of the Noctes Atticae
is concerned with grammar, literature, rhetoric, history, and
philosophy. This is precisely what we should expect in
view of the method (ἓ 9) according to which the work was
compiled, since these subjects were the main elements of a
liberal education in Gellius' day, and since, as we have seen
above (ἐξ 3-6), they were the subjects which had especially
engaged his attention.

11. Sources of the Noctes Atticae. —The sources of this
great mass of miscellaneous information are various, and
in many cases are not determinable with any degree of
exactness. Fully two hundred and seventy-five authors are
mentioned or directly quoted, while the number of indi-
vidual works cited is twice or thrice as large. The name of
nearly every one of his contemporaries appears at least once.
It is not to be supposed, however, that Gellius had himself
read every one of the works which he mentions. It is
extremely probable that he took many things from them at
second hand. For information relative to scientific matters,
ic. questions of grammar, criticism, and lexicography, he
relies chiefly upon M. Terentius Varrol (116-28 Bo), “the
most learned of the Romans‚⁷⁷ P. Nigidius Figulus (98-46
