PREFACE

 

Tmz statement of the title-page that these selections from
Aulus Gellius have been “edited for sight reading ’' calls
Δ for a few words of explanation. The term ‘⁴ sight reading ’'
may denote either of two distinct operations. On the one
hand it may apply to the pupil's aet in reading, under a
teacher’s guidance, Latin hitherto unseen. On the other
hand it may denote the student's act in reading similar
Latin by himself without the aid of a teacher. In the one
ease the pupil's ultimate reliance is upon his instructor, in
the· other upon himself. Of these two senses of the term
the latter is the one which has been kept especially in mind
in the preparation of this little volume, though there is
nothing to hinder its use according to the former method.
The book is intended for students who, while still in a very
early stage of their Latin studies, yet possess a fair working
vocabulary and a reasonable knowledge of the fundamental
principles of Latin syntax. I have aimed to give in the
commentary sufficient assistance to enable such students to
read the selections as rapidly and intelligently as possible,
’ and without the need of any helps beyond those furnished
by the book itself. Such being my purpose, I have no fears

,that the volume of commentary will be found excessive.
