Cicero's defense of old age is so charming in style and so inter-
esting in matter that it deserves something more by way of commen—
tary than mere discussion of grammatical and linguistic usage.
‚ Accordingly an attempt has· been made in the illustrative notes„ on
the pages with the text, to give prominence to the historical and
literary features of the essay, and to show by numerous quotations
what ancient and modern authors have uttered like thoughts, couched
in similar forms of expression.

In order that the chief emphasis may be placed on the literary
dement, the grammatical and textual commentary is placed in a
separate body of notes following the text. The commentaries are
supplemented by a list of variations from the text of MUller, an
index to the notes and an index of proper names.

The text is preceded by an introduction containing a life of
Cicero, a resume of his works, a valuable bibliography, and a discussion,
analysis and summary of the De Senectute.

Copies of Cicero‘s Cato [Maior De Senectute will be sent, prepaz'd‚
to any address on receipt of tlte price by the Publishers:
