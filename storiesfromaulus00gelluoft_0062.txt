AULUS GELLIUS

VI. 5

Historia de Polo histrione 1 memoratu digna.

Histrio in terra Graecia fuit fama celebri, qui ge-
stus ² et vocis claritudine et venustate ceteris antistabat —
nomen fuisse aiunt Polum—tragoedias poetarum nobilium
scite atque asseverate-‘³ actitavit. Is Polus unice ama-
tum filium morte amisit. Eum luctum quoniam satis
visus est eluxisse, rediit ad quaestum artis.

In eo tempore Athenis Electram Sophoclis* pacturus
gestare urnam quasi⁵ cum Oresti ossibus debebat. Ita
compositum fabulae argumentum⁶ est, ut veluti fratris
reliquias ferens Electra comploret commisereaturque in-
teritum⁷ eius existimatum. Igitur Polus, lugubri habitu
Electrae indutus,8 ossa atque urnam e sepulcro tulit filii
et, quasi Oresti amplexus, opplevit⁹ omnia non simula-
cris ¹⁰ neque imitamentis, sed luctu atque lamentis veris ¹¹
et spirantibus.¹2 Itaque cum agi fabula videretur, dolor¹³
actus est.

1‘actor.’ 2 gesti-is is to be taken ancient authors, *in speaking ot

with venustate, vocis with clari-
tudine. Translate: ‘in grace of
gesture and distinctness of enuncia-
tion.’ In the theaters of Greece and
Rome the play of the features, on
which modern actors rely so largely,
was entirely precluded by the huge
masks worn by the actors. Every-
thing therefore depended on the
actor’s voice and gestures. The size
of the theaters (which often accom-
modated from 15‚000 to 30,000 per-
sons) rendered a loud, sonorous
utterance necessary. Much of the
play was sung or delivered in reci-
tative, and the actor was often re-
quired to take both male and female
parts in the same play. Hence mu-
sical training was essential, and

actors, lay especial emphasis upon
the quality of their voices, often
using language “which at the pres-
ent day would seem more appro-
priate to a notice of an operatio
singer.'’ 8 ‘ earnestly.’ 4 The great
Athenian tragic poet (495-405 B.c.).
⁵ quasi. . . ossibus: ‘supposed to
contain the bones.' So in l. 10 veluti

ferens = ‘ thinking that she was car-

rying! Cf. also 1. 14, quasi amplexae.
and the use of tamquam, p. 22, n. 4.
⁶ ‘plot.’ ⁷= mortem. ⁸ ‘clad in.’
9 ‘ made the whole theater ring.' 1⁰ sc.
luctas (genitive). 11 veris is to be
taken also with luctu. 1² = ⁴ living,'
i.e. ‘ genuine.’ 18 dolor, ‘ real gries,'
is contrasted with fabula, which =
(1) ‘ a play,' and (2) ⁴ fiction.’
